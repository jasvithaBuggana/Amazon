# Secure Amazon App Deployment: A DevSecOps Approach
![Pipeline Diagram](/public/images/pipeline-diagram.png)


## Overview

This project demonstrates a secure deployment pipeline for Amazon apps using a DevSecOps approach. It integrates various tools to automate and secure the deployment process, ensuring both efficiency and robustness.

## Key Tools

- **Terraform**: Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool for provisioning AWS resources.
- **Jenkins CI/CD**: Automation server for continuous integration and continuous deployment.
- **SonarQube**: Code quality and security analysis tool.
- **Trivy**: Vulnerability scanner for containers.

## Steps to Secure Deployment

1. **Set Up Terraform**: 
   - Define and provision your AWS infrastructure using Terraform scripts.

2. **Configure Jenkins**:
   - Create a CI/CD pipeline in Jenkins to automate your build and deployment process.

3. **Integrate SonarQube**:
   - Incorporate SonarQube into the Jenkins pipeline to ensure code quality and security checks.

4. **Scan with Trivy**:
   - Use Trivy to scan Docker images for vulnerabilities before deployment.

## DevSecOps Approach

DevSecOps ensures that security is a continuous, integrated part of the development process rather than an afterthought. By automating security checks and incorporating them into the CI/CD pipeline, we can catch and address vulnerabilities early, resulting in more secure and reliable applications. Whether you're an experienced developer looking to enhance your DevSecOps skills or a newcomer eager to explore this exciting field, this guide will help you safeguard your Amazon app while ensuring smooth and efficient deployment.
